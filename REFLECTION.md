# Cookie Clicker Reflection

## What helped you understand DOM interaction best?
What helped me understand how web pages work was seeing how JavaScript can instantly change what you see on the screen. Using document.getElementById() to choose parts of the page and then changing the text after clicking a button made it really clear. Watching the counter and message change every time I clicked helped me see that the DOM is how JavaScript connects with the web page.

## How did you choose your milestone messages?
I used the suggested milestone messages, but I wanted to incorporate my favorite character, Hello Kitty, into the creativity requirement. This made the project more fun and personalized.

## What challenge or bug surprised you?
One challenge that surprised me was making sure the JavaScript ran after the web page finished loading. At first, my button click did not work because the script was not at the end of the page. Once I moved the script tag below the HTML elements, the button worked and the page updated like it should.

## What personal twist did you add?
I added a Hello Kitty theme to the clicker by using bow emojis, pink colors, and themed milestone messages. This personal touch made the project more fun and nice to look at while still showing how JavaScript events and webpage updates work.

## What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?
Shopping apps do this when users add things to their cart and see the number of items go up right after they click a button.
